package pos3d;

/**
 * <p><b>The Alt3d class is different from the standard Position3D in that the Y and Z axis are swapped.
 * In this system, Y is the vertical axis, and Z is the horizontal axis marking the 0-angle direction.</b>
 * 
 * <p>An instance of this class stores a 3D position, involving 6 doubles, an int, and an uninitialized Alt3d (null).
 * 
 * <p>With a Alt3d object, you can easily perform a wide variety of complex transformations on the 3D position stored within it, all of which function
 * properly on any coordinate system type supported by Alt3d.
 * 
 * <p>All transformation methods are chainable, meaning they return either this, or a new Alt3d, with updated values,
 * depending on whether you use a clean method or not.
 * 
 * <p>By default, transformation methods <b>do</b> alter the values of the Alt3d you call them on (they will <i>never</i> alter the values of parameters).
 * This is very helpful in various situations, and means less object-creation in general.
 * If you do need a new Alt3d, however, there is a "clean" version of every transformation method that
 * will return a new Alt3d with the values that would otherwise have been assigned to this. The new Alt3d will have the checkpoint of this as well.
 * 
 * <p>Checkpoints can be set in the middle of a method chain by calling {@link Alt3d#setCheckpoint()} or {@link Alt3d#setCheckpoint(Alt3d)}
 * on the Alt3d object. You can revert to a set checkpoint by calling {@link Alt3d#revert()} on the Alt3d object. Reverting does not alter the checkpoint.
 * 
 * <p>Methods are well optimized to not undergo unnecessary conversions, and to generally be as efficient as possible. There may be some minor infractions to this
 * statement, but as I update the library I will optimize where needed. If you are concerned with performance, then I would suggest performing all of your
 * transformations in groups corresponding to the coordinate system required by those transformations. This would remove unnecessary conversions.
